# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
    Overview of the project included learning advanced features in Excel. This included developing skills with formulas, filters, pivot tables, and various graphs for easier data visualization. This will allow us to draw conclusions from the raw data provided
### Purpose
    The purpose of this challenge was to devlop skills in navigating excel, applying filters to narrow searching and formulas to access relevant data. Visualization of this data with pivot tables, graph, pie, and line charts. This is done in order to help our client decide when the best opportunities will be to host her new play.
## Analysis and Challenges
    Visualizing the data allowed for 2 conclusions to be known. Firstly, a play has a much higher success rate if the campaign is to be launched during May or June. Worst time to launch a campaign. Secondly, in general, the cost of the campaign is inversly tied to its success rate. When a campaign requires more than $15000 startup goal there is a 50% chance or greater of failure to meet said goal. The greatest success rates can be seen with campaigns that require less than $5000 to startup. To maximize the chances of a campaign (play) becoming a success, launch the campaign in May or June. Challenges included applying correct filters, setting easy to visualize parameters for pivot tables, and correct syntax with functions
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    It can be seen the best outcome for success is during summer time, May or June. It is not recommened to launch a campaign late in the year (October or later) nor very early in the year(Jan,Feb,March).
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    Campaign goals are inversely tied to success rates, the higher the campaign goal, the lesser the chance of success. There is one particular range 40-45k which saw a 2/3 success rate. This data point is not worth including in our analysis as there were only 3 campaigns launched with this goal.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    Learning which parameters best fit a pivot table. Excel formulas can be very particular. Coloring graphs is a bit non-intuitive

## Results
To maximize the chances of a campaign (play) becoming a success, launch the campaign in May or June. Worst time to launch a campaign with a campaign startup goal of less than $5000.

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    Better chance of a play having a successful campaign during May or June. Worst time to launch a campaign are the winter months Oct, Nov, Dec

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    Most campaigns that have a goal of $15000 or greater have 50% or more of a chance to fail. However campaign goals with less than $5000 startup has about 75% success rate

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    Location is not presented. What kinds of plays were most successfull? How quickly did each successfull campaign meet their goal? Any similarities with rate of donation and failure rates? Is there any correlation between campaign length and success rate?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    Pie charts of Outcomes based on goals
    Pivot table of successful and failed campaigns with total time alloted to reach campaign
